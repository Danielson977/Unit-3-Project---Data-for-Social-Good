# Unit 3- Data for Social Good Project

## Introduction

Software engineers develop programs to work with data and provide information to a user. Each user has different needs based on the information they are looking for from data. Your goal is to create a data analysis program for your user that stores and analyzes data to provide the information they need.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, one-dimensional (1D) arrays, and algorithms to create your data analysis program:
- **Write a class** – Write a class to represent your user or business and store and analyze their data with no-argument and parameterized constructors.
- **Create at least two 1D arrays** – Create at least two 1D arrays to store the data that your user needs information about.
- **Write a method** – Write a method that finds or manipulates the elements in a 1D array to provide the information your user needs.
- **Implement a toString() method** – Write a toString() method that returns general information about the data (for example, number of values in the dataset).
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments and note any preconditions and postconditions.

## User Story 

As a member of the World Health Organization, I would like to know which countries have the worst health care, so that I can allocate my resources properly.

Question 1
What Countries have the lowest Education Budget?
Question 2
What Countries have the lowest life expectancy?
Question 3
What is the average for both values?

## Dataset 

Dataset: World Health Organization. “Datasets Archives - UNICEF DATA.” UNICEF Data, WHO, https://data.unicef.org/resources/resource-type/datasets/. Accessed 15 November 2025.

CountryName (String) – full name of the country


LifeExpectancy (double) – average life expectancy


EducationRank (int) – rank positions based on lowest education budget percentage




Example: 

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sansuthi/global-co2-emissions 
- **Country** (String) - name of the country 
- **Population** (int) - number of people in the country 
- **CO2Emissions** (double) - carbon dioxide emission in kilotons

## Description 

This was a project where we discussed the top 10 lowest life expectancy countries and lowest education budgets. We also talked about the top 10 lowest education budget percent countries. Then our app would tell you the average life expectancy and average education budget. Our user story is how I am a member of the World Health Organization. I would like to know which countries have the worst health care, so that I can allocate my resources properly. This helps us figure out the worst countries so they can gain the most assistance. The dataset is from UNICEF and we use it to see the resources and health care so we can allocate smartly.
